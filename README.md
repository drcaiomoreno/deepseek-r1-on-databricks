# DeepSeek R1 on Databricks

Deepseek-R1 is a state-of-the-art open model that, for the first time, introduces the ‘reasoning’ capability to the open source community. In particular, the release also includes the distillation of that capability into the Llama-70B and Llama-8B models, providing an attractive combination of speed, cost-effectiveness, and now ‘reasoning’ capability. We are excited to share how you can easily download and run the distilled DeepSeek-R1-Llama models in Mosaic AI Model Serving, and benefit from its security, best-in-class performance optimizations, and integration with the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. Now with these open ‘reasoning’ models, build agent systems that can even more intelligently reason on your data.
